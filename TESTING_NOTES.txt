NOTES FOR GIT TESTING
====================

Changes made on Ashmit branch:
- Created test-file-1.txt
- Created test-file-2.txt
- Created TEST_README.md
- Created TESTING_NOTES.txt

Next steps:
1. Make some edits to these files (practice making changes)
2. Use 'git status' to see what changed
3. Use 'git diff' to see the actual changes
4. Stage the files with 'git add .'
5. Commit with 'git commit -m "Your message"'
6. Push to Ashmit branch with 'git push origin Ashmit'
7. Then switch to Jaydeep branch and merge

This is a safe space to experiment and learn!
