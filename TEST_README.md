# Git Learning Test Files

This directory contains test files created for learning Git workflows.

## Files Created
1. **test-file-1.txt** - First test file
2. **test-file-2.txt** - Second test file
3. **TEST_README.md** - This file

1. ✅ Files created on `Ashmit` branch
2. Make changes to these files
3. Stage changes: `git add .`
4. Commit changes: `git commit -m "Your message"`
5. Push to Ashmit branch: `git push origin Ashmit`
6. Switch to `Jaydeep` branch
7. Merge Ashmit into Jaydeep: `git merge Ashmit`
8. Resolve any conflicts if they occur
9. Push to Jaydeep: `git push origin Jaydeep`
